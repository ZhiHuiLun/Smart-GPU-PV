ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This project was inspired by and references the implementation approach of 
Easy-GPU-PV (https://github.com/jamesstringer90/Easy-GPU-PV).

While Easy-GPU-PV does not have an explicit open source license, Smart-GPU-PV 
is a complete reimplementation in C++/Win32 with a graphical interface, and 
does not contain any direct code from Easy-GPU-PV.

Smart-GPU-PV extends Easy-GPU-PV's desktop GPU support to include laptop GPUs, 
which Easy-GPU-PV explicitly does not support. This project aims to make GPU-PV 
technology accessible to all users, including laptop users.

Special thanks to jamesstringer90 and all Easy-GPU-PV contributors for their 
pioneering work in making GPU-PV more accessible.
